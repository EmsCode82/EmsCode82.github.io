            I am <strong>Eric Shepard</strong>, a software developer with a completed 
            <strong>Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming & Database Management</strong> 
            from Cincinnati State Technical and Community College. Through this program, I gained 
            hands-on experience in <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, Java, Python, SQL Server/MySQL, 
            and web application development</strong>. My coursework and capstone projects covered 
            full-stack development, system analysis and design, database architecture, and secure 
            web application practices.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am continuing my academic path at the 
            <strong>University of Cincinnati</strong>, where I have been accepted into the 
            <strong>Bachelor of Science in Software Development</strong> program (beginning January 2026). 
            This next stage will build on my A.A.S. foundation with advanced coursework in enterprise 
            application development, mobile programming, information security, system administration, 
            and senior design projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            Beyond academics, I have completed <strong>co-op and capstone experiences</strong> such as 
            building a <em>Looking for Group (LFG) gaming platform</em> using Flutter, ASP.NET Core, 
            and SQL Server, as well as developing an <em>enterprise review system</em> with ASP.NET Core 
            Identity. These projects reflect my ability to design, build, and deliver real-world 
            applications in both solo and team environments.
            </p>
            <p>
            My professional focus is creating clean, scalable, and reliable software solutions while 
            continuously expanding my expertise in modern technologies, cloud services, and security. 
            This portfolio showcases my projects, progress, and commitment to professional growth.
